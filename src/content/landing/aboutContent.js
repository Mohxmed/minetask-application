    story: [
      `This application started as a simple idea — I often found myself overwhelmed with random tasks, side projects, and daily responsibilities. I kept jumping between notes, apps, and sticky reminders that never seemed to help much.`,
      `So I decided to build something for myself — a small space where I could break down big goals into tiny, manageable steps, keep track of progress, and feel more in control of my day. That’s how this app was born.`,
      `It’s not just a to-do list — it’s a personal companion to help me stay focused, organized, and motivated. And maybe, if it helps someone else out there too, then that’s a bonus I’m proud of.`,
